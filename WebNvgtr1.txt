InterNotes Web Navigator provides managed, secure access to the Internet and Web!

InterNotes Web Navigator delivers &quot;Team Surfing&quot; allowing users to share the experience of the Internet within a workgroup or as individuals.  Web Navigator is much more than a browsing tool, it is Internet access integrated into the core Notes environment, enabling teams of users to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate Web content.  Web Navigator database (WEB.NSF) features, such as Web Tours, Recommended Pages, and views, uniquely transform the experience of an individual surfing the web into a team experience of sharing valuable knowledge.

By supplying this capability in the form of @functions and LotusScript methods, Lotus gives the Notes development community the opportunity to make every application a web application.  Customers can completely customize the look &amp; feel of the Web by modifying the Web Navigator database.
